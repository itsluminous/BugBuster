# BugBuster
Chrome extension to capture replication steps along with network data and browser console data

For now, the bug replay feature does not work in Chrome, and in Firefox works after enabling  privacy.file_unique_origin flag
open Firefox, then open about:config, then search for privacy.file_unique_origin, change it to false
